    "In this example, we will walk through some key steps for taking an LLM-based pipeline to production.  Our pipeline will be familiar to you from previous modules: summarization of news articles using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.  But in this walkthrough, we will be more rigorous about LLMOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Develop an LLM pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LLMOps goals during development are (a) to track what we do carefully for later auditing and reproducibility and (b) to package models or pipelines in a format which will make future deployment easier.  Step-by-step, we will:\n",
    "* Load data.\n",
    "* Build an LLM pipeline.\n",
    "* Test applying the pipeline to data, and log queries and results to MLflow Tracking.\n",
    "* Log the pipeline to the MLflow Tracking server as an MLflow Model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test the LLM pipeline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LLMOps goals during testing (in the staging or QA stage) are (a) to track the LLM's progress through testing and towards production and (b) to do so programmatically to demonstrate the APIs needed for future CI/CD automation.  Step-by-step, we will:\n",
    "* Register the pipeline to the MLflow Model Registry.\n",
    "* Test the pipeline on sample data.\n",
    "* Promote the registered model (pipeline) to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a production workflow for batch inference**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our LLMOps goals during production are (a) to write scale-out code which can meet scaling demands in the future and (b) to simplify deployment by using MLflow to write model-agnostic deployment code.  Step-by-step, we will:\n",
    "* Load the latest production LLM pipeline from the Model Registry.\n",
    "* Apply the pipeline to an Apache Spark DataFrame.\n",
    "* Append the results to a Delta Lake table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes about this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook vs. modular scripts**: Since this demo is in a single notebook, we will divide the workflow from development to production via notebook sections.  In a more realistic LLM Ops setup, you would likely have the sections split into separate notebooks or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Promoting models vs. code**: We track the path from development to production via the MLflow Model Registry.  That is, we are *promoting models* towards production, rather than promoting code.  For more discussion of these two paradigms, see [\"The Big Book of MLOps\"](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/the-big-book-of-mlops).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ![Dolly](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/dolly_small.png) Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. Walk through a simple but realistic workflow to take an LLM pipeline from development to production.\n",
    "1. Make use of MLflow Tracking and the Model Registry to package and manage the pipeline.\n",
    "1. Scale out batch inference using Apache Spark and Delta Lake."

         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

         "Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he \"can see the finishing line\" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return.\nThe German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap.\nHe said: \"It is heavy mentally to accept that.\"\nGundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.\n\"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\"\nGundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.\nHe is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\nManager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.\nGundogan said: \"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.\n\"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\"\nCity complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.\nSpurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.\nAnd Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\nHe said: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\n\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\n\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"",

       "\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n",

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.",

         "But there certainly should be.\nThese are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?",

         "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare.\nShe is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme.\nHouvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures.\nThe report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment.\nBritish Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview.\nBoth Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling.\nHouvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture.\nA government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently.\nIt is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies.\nHouvenaghel claimed:\nBritish Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\".\nIt said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\".\nThe statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\"\nWho else has spoken out?\nHouvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011.\nShe retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury.\nHouvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission.\nAt the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\".\nHe added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\"\nBritish Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\".\nOther elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling.\nAsked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"",

         "It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\nBT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.",
         "The reaction from BT's investors told us much about media regulator Ofcom's ruling on the fate of Openreach, the BT subsidiary that provides much of the UK's broadband infrastructure.",

We know it's going to be a tough game. We anticipated that the last time.\"\nRodgers is also aware Celtic's visit to Hampden last season in the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers ended in defeat.\n\"The last experience there wasn't so good for Celtic,\" he said. \"But it's a different team with a different mentality and we'll look to take that mentality into the game.\"\nRodgers lost two semi-finals in his time at Liverpool and is aiming to make it third time lucky at the club he joined in the summer.\n\"You have to perform - that's what's important and if you get little bit of luck along the way then hopefully you'll get the result that you want.\" said the Northern Irishman.\n\"So, for us, it's really looking at our performance level, which in the main has been at a really high level.\n\"My focus is always on my own team and, if we impose our style of play, it can give a lot of problems to opponents.\"\nUnlike predecessor Ronny Deila, Rodgers would not be drawn on this semi-final being a step on the way to a potential domestic treble.\n\"It's very, very difficult to achieve,\" he said. \"There's been great managers here in the past that haven't achieved that.\n\"But it's the first competition where we've a chance to win a trophy and I've always said that it's a priority for us because it's the first one.\n\"Our idea was to qualify for the Champions League, which we did, to make a good start in the league, which we've done, and then look to get to the League Cup final.\n\"Unless you can do that then you don't have the chance to win the trophies.\"",

       "\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\n",
       "But there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\n",

       "\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n",
       "\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\n",
       "If the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\n",
       "It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\n",
       "One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n",
       "\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\n",
       "In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n",
       "\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\n",
       "Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\n",
       "But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\n",
       "Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\n",
       "When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\n",
       "For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\n",
       "In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\n",

       "Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\n",
       "These are:\n",
       "An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\n",

       "\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n",
       "\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\n",
       "The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\n",
       "But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n",
       "\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n",
       "\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\n",
       "If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\n",
       "Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\n",
       "Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\n",
       "They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\n",
       "But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\n",
       "On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\n",

       "\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n",

       "And he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\n",
       "Mr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n",
       "\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\n",
       "Mr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\n",
       "An industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n",
       "\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n",
       "\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\n",
       "While the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n",
       "\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n",
       "\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\n",
       "Mr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n",
       "\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\n",
       "But clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n",
       "\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n",
       "\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n",
       "\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\n",
       "The middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\n",
       "Top-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\n",
       "Steve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\n",
       "He describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\n",
       "And although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\n",
       "Mr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n",
       "\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n",
       "\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\n",
       "Mr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n",
       "\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n",
       "\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\n",
       "While the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n",
       "\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n",
       "\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n",
       "\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\n",
       "But in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\n",
       "Back in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\n",
       "He says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n",

       "Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\n",
       "Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\n",
       "Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\n",
       "BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\n",
       "This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\n",
       "It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\n",
       "BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\n",

Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.",

         "But there certainly should be.\nThese are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?",

         "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe Olympic silver medallist accused the organisation of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for her welfare.\nShe is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the World Class programme.\nHouvenaghel told the BBC she felt \"vindicated\" by a leaked draft report detailing British Cycling's failures.\nThe report said British Cycling \"sanitised\" its own investigation into claims former technical director Shane Sutton used sexist language towards Varnish, who went public last April about her treatment.\nBritish Cycling subsequently admitted it did not pay \"sufficient care and attention\" to the wellbeing of staff and athletes at the expense of winning medals, an approach Houvenaghel attested to in her BBC interview.\nBoth Sutton and predecessor Sir Dave Brailsford have now left British Cycling.\nHouvenaghel, 42, spoke to BBC Sport during its State of Sport week, which on Thursday examines the issue of athlete welfare versus a win-at-all-costs culture.\nA government-commissioned review, headed by 11-time Paralympic champion Baroness Grey-Thompson, into safety and wellbeing in British sport, is due to be published imminently.\nIt is expected to recommend significant reforms designed to improve the way athletes are treated by governing bodies.\nHouvenaghel claimed:\nBritish Cycling said it \"has acknowledged and takes very seriously previous cultural and governance failings in the World Class Programme\".\nIt said it has accepted the draft report's findings and already put into a place a 39-point action plan to \"systematically address the cultural and behavioural shortcomings\".\nThe statement added: \"Our new chair Jonathan Browning has apologised for instances where we have fallen short in our commitment to athlete welfare and has offered to meet with anyone who can help improve British Cycling.\"\nWho else has spoken out?\nHouvenaghel won silver in the individual pursuit at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and gold in the World Championship team pursuit in 2008, 2009 and 2011.\nShe retired in 2014, aged 39, after withdrawing from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow with a back injury.\nHouvenaghel was critical of both Sutton and her team-mates in the aftermath of the London 2012 Olympics, where she was left out of all three team pursuit races as Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell-Shand won gold in a world record time.\nSpeaking to BBC Sport this week, the Northern Irish rider said that experience was \"very traumatic\" and she felt \"torment\" at having \"no explanation\" for her last-minute omission.\nAt the time, Brailsford, then performance director, defended the selection saying they had to \"take the personal element out of it, and look at the data and be professional\".\nHe added: \"I think when a team steps up and makes six world records on the trot and a gold medal, then I don't think you can argue with that.\"\nBritish Cycling reiterated that point on Thursday, adding it was \"proud to support Wendy in what was a wonderfully successful cycling career\" and she was \"part of a pioneering generation of riders who set new standards of excellence\", but was dropped in London 2012 \"based on her performance\".\nOther elite cyclists, including King and Roswell-Shand have praised the leadership at British Cycling.\nAsked whether she was simply not good enough for the 2012 team, Houvenaghel replied: \"It was definitely not about performance. I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"",

         "It's no joke. But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

         "Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading.\nBT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons.\nShe said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years.\nIt's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\nBT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.",
